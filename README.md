Second attempt to make Google's TensorFlow available on cloud 9. Also trying to get udacities TensorFlow course working.


Feb 8th, 2016
My first attempt to get TensorFlow working online was with the github site https://github.com/hpssjellis/easy-tensorflow-on-cloud9 and a youtube video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMtrOIPLpR0

That worked but had some issues, so this is the 2nd attempt.
